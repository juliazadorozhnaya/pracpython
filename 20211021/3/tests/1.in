It happened !<"№%:about a year!<"№%:, ago. Our family!"<№%:, bought a new car, !"<№%:and parents!"<№%: decided to !"№%:,celebrate it all!"№%:, together "!№%:,.in the cafe. 
We enjoyed great!"№%:, food, had a !<"№%:,conversation and a lot!"№!%":№%, of fun. Dad !"<№"%№:%,was happy and he !"№%:,told us many!"№%: jokes, !"№%":everybody laughed more!"<№%№ and more. 
We!"№%: played the !"№%:,.fools and!"№%:, couldn’t stop.When<!"№%:, it was time to go, !"№%:,Dad paid and "!№%:,left cafe to warm up the car, and Mom, her !"№%:friend, my "!№%:,.brother and I !"№%:,lingered in the!"№%:,. cafe. 
When !"№%:we went out, !"№%:,we realised that it was!"№%:, already dark outside!"№%:,. — so !"№%:,we couldn’t see !"№%:,well. And the second!"№%:,.№%:!"№% thing we !"№%:,reailsed was !"№%:,the fact, that nobody can !"№%:remember exactly, what our "№%":№,.new car looks "!№%like! 
But Mom !"№%confidently went toward!"№% the !"№%Еblack car, that !"№%was standing !"№%:nearly. 
«Oh, !"№%Dad is waiting!"№% inside, !"№%it’s ours. Come!"№ on». 
Just imagine: the company!"№%:, of №%:,.;(four very noisy !"№%:people, singing, talking "№%:,.loudly, laughing out!"№%:,., get !"№%into "№"%car"!№. 
Mum №%:turn to driver "№and№%: exclaimed cheerfully: 
«Sasha, let’s go!»…
The driver looked№%:,. at us with eyes full"№%:,. of fear and cried"№%: out desperatly: 
«I am not Sasha, I am Egor!!! Who are you?!»Then"№%: we, absolutly confused!"№%:, and quiet, get in the right"№%:,. car, we told Dad about it. He!"№ couldn’t/// drive for minutes-- becouse,, of laughing.
